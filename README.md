## Basis

Web Application for making competitive Pokémon teams. The application will allow you to
create teams and give you their weakness and suggest Pokémon/moves to improve your team.
The site will save teams you have made and allow you to share them.

## Requirements

#### API

For this project I usd the poke api to bring in data. I was able to get images, stats, typings and moves from the api. There is still a lot more the api has to offer that would be beneficial to my project such as items. Working with the Poke api has shown me how hard it can be to move data between components and pages.

#### Multiple Application States

I currently have 4 different pages being home, builder, teams and resources.

#### Progress Indicator

Currently there is no loader functionally in my application, but will be added in the future.
